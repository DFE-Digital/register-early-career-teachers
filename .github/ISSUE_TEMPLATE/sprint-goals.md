## Test and preparation objectives

Test a data model for all ECF-related digital services to inform the start of development. 👾

Create and iterate prototypes to inform how we can improve the registration of ECTs and mentors for schools. :school:

Test and iterate naming and separation of ECF digital services and terminology used within them. ✏️

Decide what data we need to migrate to ECF 2.0, how we will do so and build the required infrastructure. ✈️

Prepare repositories, documentation and devvy stuff to prepare us to build 2.0. 🔨

Test with lead providers our ideas for solutions and get their feedback :cloud:
