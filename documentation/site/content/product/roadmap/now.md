## Now 🏃

* exploring using DfE sign in for school users and allowing multiple accounts, so we can improve their access to the service 
* improving how an early career teacher or mentor is registered, so we save schools time and improve data accuracy
* improving how records for ECTs and mentors are viewed, so we can remind them of essential actions they need to take and can make changes to records easily
* designing a prototype and setting up the infrastructure for a service where appropriate bodies can submit induction data, so we improve the accuracy of our data and can later consolidate registration for schools
* setting up processes for how we will migrate data from the legacy service to our new service, so that we can migrate data from ECF1 to ECF2 efficiently and cleanly
