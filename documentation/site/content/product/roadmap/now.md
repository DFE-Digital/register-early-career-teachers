## Now üèÉ

* exploring using DfE sign in for school users and allowing multiple accounts, so we can improve their access to the service 
* improving how an early career teacher or mentor is registered, so we save schools time and improve data accuracy
* improving how records for ECTs and mentors are viewed, so we can remind them of essential actions they need to take and can make changes to records easily
* designing a prototype and setting up the infrastructure for a service where appropriate bodies can submit induction data, so we improve the accuracy of our data and can later consolidate registration for schools
* setting up processes for how we will migrate data from the legacy service to our new service, so that we can migrate data from ECF1 to ECF2 efficiently and cleanly. ECF1 is the current service, ECF 2 is the future service this team is designing and building.
