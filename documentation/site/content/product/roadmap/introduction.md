## Why we're sharing our roadmap publicly 
This document explains what we're working on to improve and rebuild the digital services that facilitate the early career framework (ECF) policy reforms. These digital services are named Register early career teachers.

It sets out what we're working on now, what will come next, and what we might pursue later. 

By sending this out publicly, we hope to:

* give direction and vision to our team
* be transparent about what we're working on and why
* prioritise what we need to work on and when
* gather more feedback about the work we're aiming to do

## Our objectives
All of these items of work are related to our objectives as a team. Our objectives are structured to enable us to meet the Teaching CPD vision of services serving their core purposes and being flexible enough to adapt to future change and opportunities.

1. Reduce workload for schools when registering early career teachers and their mentors for training 🏫
2. Improve data quality and the flexibility of the services by changing the data model and migrating data cleanly to Register early career teachers 👾
3. Better meet lead provider needs by showing the right data over the Lead provider API, improving documentation and updating validation rules ☁️
4. Improve understanding of financial information internally and make sure payments are calculated correctly 💰
5. Ensure the successful development of the Register early career teacher services by planning for dependencies, risks and communications 🗒️
6. Minimise time and money spent on support tasks by creating improved joint support and finance tooling 🦸
7. Improve how data on ECF is reported and create performance metrics for the new Register early career teachers services 📊
8. Reduce confusion for users by helping them understand how the Register early career teacher services are structured, the service's purposes and their own responsibilities ✏️
9. Build services that are safe, protect privacy and are tested and documented well 🔨
10. Save time for appropriate bodies to submit induction data for early career teachers and check relevant training information in 1 place ⏲️
