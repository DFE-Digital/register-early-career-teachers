title: Record induction as an appropriate body
---

Use this service if you’re an appropriate body supporting the induction of early career teachers (ECTs).

You’ll need to give details about: 

* who you’re supporting, or no longer supporting
* the induction history and progress of your ECTs
* whether an ECT has passed or failed, or had their induction extended
