      Before recording an extension, a final assessment must have been completed by the ECT's School Induction Tutor or Headteacher, which provides a recommendation on the ECT's performance against the Teaching Standards. As an Appropriate Body, you must have made a final decision on whether to extend the induction on the basis of this recommendation.

      You do not need to record an extension when an induction needs to be extended due to a period of extended absence (an "automatic extension")
