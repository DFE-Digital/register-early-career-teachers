title: You cannot register a mentor without a TRN
---

If they:

- had a TRN but cannot find it, ask them to use the [Find a lost TRN service](https://find-a-lost-trn.education.gov.uk/start)
- have never had one, they'll need to [request a TRN](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn#if-youre-a-mentor-for-a-trainee-or-early-career-teacher)
