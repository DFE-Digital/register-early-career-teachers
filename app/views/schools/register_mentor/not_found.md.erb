You can check the mentor's teacher reference number (TRN) is accurate by [reviewing their teacher record](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-a-teachers-record).

Alternatively, you can ask the mentor to check their TRN by using the [Find a lost TRN service](https://find-a-lost-trn.education.gov.uk/start).
