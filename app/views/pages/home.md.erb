title: Register early career teachers
---

Use this service to register your school’s early career teachers (ECTs) for early career framework (ECF) training.

You need to register your ECTs and their mentors with the Department for Education (DfE) so that they can receive:

- access to DfE-funded training
- funding to support their time off timetable for mentoring and training

### What you’ll need

You’ll need to provide these details for both ECTs and mentors:

- name
- teacher reference number (TRN)
- date of birth
- email address
- lead provider
- delivery partner

For ECTs only, you’ll also need to submit the following information:

- appropriate body
- training programme (school-led or provider-led)
- start date at your school (month and year they started as an ECT)

If any of these details change, you can use this service to update them.

You'll need to sign in using DfE Sign-in.
